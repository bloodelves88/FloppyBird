# About FloppyBird
I made this Flappy Bird clone not with the purpose of making a revoluntionary new game with never before seen ideas, but with the aim to practice game programming.

# Aims
1. Make a 2D game using the Unity game engine for the first time.
2. Understand the new Unity UI system.
3. Use Unity 5 for the first time (already experienced with Unity 4)
3. Make a randomly generated level for the first time.
4. Be able to optimize the level such that the number of obstacles in the scene should not increase even though the player progresses deep into the level.
